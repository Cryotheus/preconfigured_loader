# Preconfigured Loader
Loader for GMod addons that is easy to configure and supports subfolders.

This was originally designed for my gamemode [Minge Defense](https://github.com/Cryotheus/minge_defense) but after copying into a fourth project I decided to give it its own repository so I don't have several different loaders with different features.

A guide on how to use this is in [the only script provided](https://github.com/Cryotheus/preconfigured_loader/blob/main/lua/autorun/loader.lua).
